# Mira_internship_task_2
This project is a simple application that uses the Python Tkinter module to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for performing basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project consists of two main components: a calculator and a validation. The calculator allows the user to enter numbers and operators using buttons and displays the result in an entry widget. The calculator supports decimal numbers, parentheses, and order of operations. The validation checks the user input for any errors, such as invalid syntax, division by zero, or overflow, and shows an appropriate message in a label widget. The validation uses the eval function to evaluate the user input as a Python expression and handles any exceptions that may occur. The GUI has 20 buttons: 10 for digits (0-9), 4 for operators (+, -, *, /), 2 for parentheses ((), 1 for decimal point (.), 1 for equal sign (=), 1 for clear Â©, and 1 for delete (DEL). The GUI also has two widgets: an entry widget for showing the user input and the result, and a label widget for showing the validation message. The project demonstrates how to use Tkinter widgets, such as buttons, entry, and label, to create a simple but functional GUI application in Python.
